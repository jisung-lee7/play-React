## :label: React
- The library for web and native user interfaces
<br><br>

### Create user interfaces from components
### Write components with code and markup
### Add interactivity wherever you need it
### Go full-stack with a framework
### Use the best from every platform
<br><br>

## :label: JSX
- JavaScript eXtensions
- The Rules of JSX
   1. Return a single root element 
   2. Close all the tags or self-closing tags
   3. camelCase all most of the things
   4. Using JavaScript Expressions with Curly Braces {}
   5. Use className Instead of class
<br><br>

## :label: Props
- React components use props to communicate with each other. 
- Every parent component can pass some information to its child components by giving them props. 
- Props might remind you of HTML attributes, but you can pass any JavaScript value through them, including objects, arrays, and functions.
